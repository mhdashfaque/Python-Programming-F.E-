AIM: 5. Calculating Simple Interest:
Write a Python program to calculate
the simple interest based on user input.
The program should prompt the user to enter the principal amount,
the rate of interest, and the time period in years.
It should then compute the simple interest using the formula
Simple Interest=(Principal×Rate×Time) /100
and display the result.

# Prompt the user for the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period
principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest: "))
time = float(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))

# Calculate simple interest using the formula
simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

# Display the result
print(f"\nThe simple interest is: {simple_interest:.2f}")
